# WhatsApp UI Clone

This is a front-end clone of WhatsApp built with React Native and Expo. I created it to practice building mobile layouts, working with navigation, and getting more comfortable with React Native in general. The goal was to learn and replicate WhatsApp’s interface as closely as possible.

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- React Native (JavaScript)
- Expo
- React Navigation

---

## ✨ What’s Working

- Updates Screen
- Calls Screen
- Chat list screen with avatar and preview messages
- Chatroom screen with a layout similar to WhatsApp
- Communities Screen
- Settings Screen
- Header navigation and basic structure
- Touchable components for a mobile feel
- Designed and tested using Expo Go

---

## 🛠️ How I Built It

- Started a new Expo project using `npx expo start`
- Set up React Navigation with stack and tab navigators
- Broke down WhatsApp’s interface into different screens and components
- Used Flexbox for layout and spacing (which was a challenge at times 😅)
- Styled everything with React Native's built-in StyleSheet
- Tested it live on my phone using the Expo Go app

---

## 🎯 Why I Did This

I wanted to get hands-on experience with React Native by building something real, or at least, something that looks real. Cloning WhatsApp felt like a good challenge because it’s a familiar app with a clean and consistent UI.

## 📚 What I Learned

- Navigating between screens with React Navigation
- Creating reusable UI components (like chat bubbles, headers)
- Managing layout issues with Flexbox (it’s tricky but powerful!)
- How mobile UIs differ from web UIs
- The importance of detail when recreating an existing app

---

## 🔜 What’s Next

- Hook it up to Firebase for authentication and real-time chat
- Allow users to send images using Expo Image Picker
- Add dark mode
- Show typing indicators or online status
- Push notifications

## 📸 Demo

Coming soon! I’ll add a quick screen recording or GIF to show the UI.

## 📌 Note

This project is just for learning. It’s not connected to WhatsApp or Meta in any way. No real chat functionality — yet. 🙂
